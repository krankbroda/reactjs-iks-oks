## Project description

This is a simple React app built by following the initial tutorial on the [React homepage](https://react.io/). The project demonstrates the basic usage of ES6 and JSX, several ReactJS components separated into classes and some basic data-flow between them. 

The work done here doesn't follow exactly the before mentioned tutorial. I separated all the classes in their own files and played around a bit with some inline css in the Title class.

## Runinng the app

Open up a terminal in the project root folder and first install all dependencies with `npm i`, after that is completed run `npm start` to run the app.
